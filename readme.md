# The origin of Vierordt's law

## Abstract

In 1868, Karl Vierordt discovered one type of errors in time perception?an overestimation of short duration and underestima-tion 
of long durations, known as Vierordt?s law. Here we reviewed the original study in its historical context and 
asked whether Vierordt?slaw is a result of an unnatural experimental randomization protocol. 
Using iterative Bayesian updating, we simulated the original resultswith high accuracy. 
Importantly, the model also predicted that a slowly changing random-walk sequence produces less central tendency 
than a random sequence with the same durations. This was validated by a duration reproduction experiment 
from two sequences (randomand random walk) with the same sampled distribution. 
The results showed that trial-wise variation influenced the magnitude of Vierordt?slaw. 
We concluded that Vierordt?s law is caused by an unnatural yet widely used experimental protocol


## Experimental data and code

1. rep_randwalk.mat - experimental data of duration reproduction.
2. data_fit_paper.m - simulate and fit the experimental data
3. fitdata1pv.m and kmodel1pv.m - optimization functions
